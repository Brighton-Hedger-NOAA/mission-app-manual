# Gather and Prepare Materials

### Before beginning the archiving process, you will need to locate and prepare three key items.

---

## 1. Dataset (.csv)

## 2. Data Dictionary (.csv)
This file describes the columns and contents of your dataset.

* **Note:** If the dataset's structure (i.e., the columns) ***has not* changed** since the last archive, you can simply find and copy the data dictionary from the previous archive package.

    If the structure ***has* changed**, you will need to create or update the data dictionary to match. You will perform a detailed review of this in the next step.

## 3. Dataset Details Document (Google Docs)
Click <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QxNAybnQApw_rs1DbCpy5LbgxTPhm5f8?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>here</strong></a> to see all of the them. Find the one for your specfifi dataset


* **Action:** From the document, find and copy the URL for the **new InPort record** that you will be updating.
* **Action:** For reference, also save/copy the URL for the **most recent *archived* InPort record**.
