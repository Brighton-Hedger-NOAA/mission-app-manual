# Prepare S2N Package
### After the InPort record is complete, the next phase is to prepare the "Submit to NCEI" (S2N) package. This process creates the formal submission for NCEI.

## S2N Preparation Checklist

- [ ] **Find and copy a similar S2N stub**

- [ ] **Update the Points of Contact (POCs)**
    > - Data Manager for the dataset 
    > - Ideally include at least 2 relevant “responsible” persons (i.e., the Data Steward, Data Manager, Data Archivist, or Project/team Lead)

- [ ] **Make sure title is descriptive of the dataset, or follows the last archive dataset format / structure**

- [ ] **Write a specific abstract**
> - The S2N abstract should be less verbose than the one in InPort. It needs to be specific to the exact dataset that is being archived.
>   - *For example: '2024 Vital Rates coral annotations from imagery collected in the Hawaiian Archipelago' vs 'Vital rates coral annotations from 2024 across Pacific Islands regions'*

- [ ] **Check the References section**
> Ensure that the correct InPort record URL is provided in the references.

- [ ] **Review Data Types**
> Ensure that the correct InPort record URL is provided in the references.

- [ ] **Get a peer review**
>  Before submitting, have a team member review both the S2N package and the updated InPort record.
