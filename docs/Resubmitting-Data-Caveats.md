# Caveats: Re-submitting Already Archived Data
### This guide covers the specific scenario where you are not creating a new archive package, but rather updating an existing one that already has a single NCEI accession number.

---

## Single Accession

* Your InPort record only references **one single link** to NCEI for the entire dataset.
* All data for that record, including historical and new data, should be downloadable from this single link
* **Note:** Each update submission has a **100GB maximum**

## The Re-submission Process

Follow these steps to update a dataset under an existing accession:

1.  **Review InPort As-Necessary**
    * Dataset timeframe, publication date, abstract, etc.

2.  **Make Updates to the Accession via Email**
    * Fill out this **[Accession Update Request Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaP-AS7OjsPqfHe57Tx0CAsznjjj090oU7KwOUOKvfQ/edit?usp=sharing)** and send it to the DST
    * DST will send that email to make updates to accession itself via email to NCEI

## Examples of When to Use This Would Apply

This method is ideal for ongoing monitoring projects where new data is periodically added to an established collection.

* **Satellite tagged locations of derelict fishing nets:** Used when you are simply adding more GPS coordinates and times to the existing dataset.
* **Kahekili dataset**
